# Schema: Landing Page Improvement Roadmap

**Deliverable**: `deliverables/landing-page/roadmap.md`
**User Story**: P3 - Landing Page Improvement Roadmap
**Purpose**: Define the structure for the prioritized improvement roadmap

## Required Sections

1. **Roadmap Overview** - Strategic approach, phasing rationale, overall timeline estimate
2. **Phase Breakdown** - For each phase:
   - Phase name and number
   - Included improvements (features, UX enhancements, technical upgrades)
   - Priority (P1/P2/P3/P4)
   - Effort estimate (S/M/L/XL with hour ranges)
   - Dependencies (what must be done first)
   - Success criteria (measurable outcomes)
   - Deliverables (specific outputs)
   - Parallelization potential
3. **Dependency Graph** - Mermaid diagram showing phase dependencies
4. **Effort Summary** - Total effort by phase, cumulative timeline
5. **Quick Wins** - Low-effort, high-impact improvements for early momentum
6. **Risk Factors** - Technical risks, dependency risks, resource constraints
7. **Parallel Workstreams** - Phases that can be developed concurrently

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] All improvements from future-state.md mapped to phases
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] At least 30% of phases can be parallelized (SC-008)
- [ ] Each phase has clear entry/exit criteria
- [ ] Effort estimates reviewed and calibrated
- [ ] Development team can estimate timeline with ±20% accuracy (SC-003)
- [ ] Quick wins identified for early delivery
- [ ] Dependency graph validated with technical team

## Success Criteria Mapping

- **SC-003**: Enable ±20% timeline estimation accuracy
- **SC-008**: Enable parallel work streams (30%+ of phases)
- **FR-007**: Create prioritized improvement roadmap
- **FR-008**: Estimate effort for each phase
- **FR-009**: Identify dependencies between phases
